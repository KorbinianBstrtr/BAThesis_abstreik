This repository contains all of the implementation and results of the Thesis "Physically constrained networks" written at the Technical University of Munich. The thesis can be found at TUM_Thesis/main.pdf.

### Summary:
We incorporate physical constraints into deep learning models to improve performance in terms of test loss and physical feasibility of the predictions. We apply the Penalty Method, the Augmented Lagrangian Method and Physical Projection to the problem of learning a rotation. Physical constraints include norm preservation and a determinant of one of the rotation matrix. The first two methods achieve significant performance improvements and lower physical constraint violations, while the Physical Projection method does not seem to be helpful.
