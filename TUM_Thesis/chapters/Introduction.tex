\section{Introduction}

In recent years, deep learning models have proven to perform well in a wide range of applications, many of which include working with real world data. For example, Neural Networks have successfully been applied to the task of modeling lake temperature \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1710-11431} and fluid dynamics \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/SinghMD16}. Traditionally, such behaviours have been simulated by hand-crafted models. They were designed in a way to align with physical principles, such as gravity, the conservation of energy, or Newton's laws. This leads to high precision and avoids the problem of generalization, since the theories are assumed to be true accross the whole domain space. Nevertheless, manually building models requires intense effort and domain knowledge, and their performance may suffer from flawed parameter estimates or theories. In contrast, deep learning models do not rely on the complex underlying system structure. They can simply learn the behaviour from previously observed data. Furthermore, the latter outperform hand-crafted models in speed and can be applied even when no scientific theories are known. However, this comes to the high cost of large amounts of training data that is required for data-driven models to create realistic predictions aligning with physical principles. In addition, the data needs to be spread accross the whole domain space, which is often not the case. A lack of data in one region will already lead to unrealistic model predictions in that area, since the deep learning model does not specifically learn the physical rules and can therefore not generalize well.\\
\indent This raises the question, whether we can combine the scientific knowledge and the power of deep learning models in order to achieve more realistic results. Instead of purely relying on data, we can actively train the network to align its predictions with known physical principles. This could improve generalization and help to decrease the amount of data required and to create more realistic predictions.\\
